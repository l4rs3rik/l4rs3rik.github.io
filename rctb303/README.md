# Roland Cloud TB-303 skin
```
I'm on Windows myself and I have no idea if this works on the Mac version. (Might be some library folder 
with the png files on Mac but I don't know if that is the case.)

Disclaimer: 
This is basically a hack, it's about replacing PNG (graphics) files so this isn't supported in any way by Roland. If 
you try out this skin it is a good idea to backup the original files so you fast and easy can do a restore.

HowTo:
1. Download and unzip

2. Copy the png files to the Roland TB-303 script folder (C:\Program Files\Roland VS\TB-303\Script) replacing the 
original files.

So far I haven't had any problems with the plug-in after replacing the graphics apart for some jagged graphics and 
weird scaling issues in Ableton. (Behaves better in Cubase)
