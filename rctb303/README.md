# Roland Cloud TB-303 skin
```

Disclaimer: 
- This is basically a hack, it's about replacing PNG (graphics) files so this isn't supported in any way by Roland. It's
a good idea to backup the original files, makes it fast and easy to go back.

- I'm on Windows myself and I have no idea if this works on the Mac version. (Might be some library folder 
with the png files on Mac but I don't know if that is the case.)

HowTo:
1. Download and unzip

2. Copy the png files to the Roland TB-303 script folder (C:\Program Files\Roland VS\TB-303\Script) replacing the 
original files.
