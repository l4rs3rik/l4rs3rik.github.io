# Microtonic skins

In the Microtonic v3.3.2 public beta (and later versions) the skin format has changed. So the
resources that used to be here are now moved to a github repository setup by the good people 
over at sonic charge: [fredli74/microtonic-skins](https://github.com/fredli74/microtonic-skins).

Previews of the skins:
